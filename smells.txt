1)The code from 558-568 is repeated on lines 606-616, hence we the Duplicate expressions in the same class code smell. To fix this, you would simply create an extract method, copy the repeated code into the method and then replace lines 558-568 and 606-616 with two method calls, each to the same method. 

3.) I do not believe that this new extract method named “updateAndTrim” does belong in the Nodes class because it is a method used by many other classes. This is called a Move Method and you fix it by moving it simply into an outer class that is already used often.

4.) I believe that this duplicate code could be eliminated with just a simple for loop encasing the 5 lines of code since we know four times is how many times the code should be repeated. It would look something like this:

	for(int j=0; j<4; j++){
		i++;
		if (i < chars.length){
			hex.append(chars[i]);
		} else {
			break;
		}
	}


6.) I chose to refactor 20 lines that were duplicated in the same file called “CronTabTest.java” under the methods “testCeil4()” and “testCeil5()”. The repeated lines were not method declarations but rather just the same repeated method calls scattered across 20 lines. So, I simply created an extract method called “testCeilExtracted()”.
